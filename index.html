  <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
<p></p>
Progressive Enhancement is a method of web building that prioritzes content structure first, before CSS or Javascript. The idea is that a web developer building a website would start the process by creating the content of the site with HTML. After that, the developer would implement CSS to design the site to their liking. Lastely, Javascript would be used to help the site run well on various browsers. The Progressive Enhancement will help a developer build a website from the ground, while also reaching as wide of an audience as possible in a structured and thourough method. This model is important to modern web development because it ensures that each website using this method, is viewed by as many people as possible while also delivering a structured and competent experience.
